# Wildfire Prediction from Satellite Data (California 2020)

This example demonstrates wildfire prediction using satellite-derived vegetation indices and land surface temperature, comparing:

- Baseline Neural Network (PyTorch)
- Neural Network with PerforatedAI dendrite restructuring

The goal is to evaluate whether dynamic dendrite growth improves classification performance under extreme class imbalance.

## Dataset

The dataset integrates three NASA Earthdata sources:

- FIRMS (VIIRS 375m) – Active fire detections  
- MODIS MOD13Q1 – NDVI & EVI vegetation indices (16-day composite)  
- MODIS MOD11A2 – Land Surface Temperature (8-day composite, averaged to 16-day windows)  

Final processed dataset:

- ~18M valid 1 km² pixels  
- ~0.08% fire pixels (extremely imbalanced)  
- Train / Val / Test split: 70 / 15 / 15  

For neural network experiments:

- Training uses a subsampled and balanced subset: all positives and a limited number of negatives, for stability and speed.
- Validation and test sets are also balanced, so precision, recall, and F1 metrics are meaningful.
- Full dataset imbalance is not used in this experiment — the model is trained on a balanced subset, but dendrite growth is still tested for its ability to improve classification.

## Model Architecture

```
Input (4 features)
->  Linear(4 -> 64)
->  ReLU
->  Linear(64 -> 64)
->  ReLU
->  Linear(64 -> 1)
```

- Output uses logits, with BCEWithLogitsLoss.
- pos_weight is dynamically set to balance classes during training, emphasizing positive fire pixels.
- Threshold for predictions: logits > 0 -> positive class.

The same architecture is used for:

- Baseline model
- Dendrite-enhanced model (PerforatedAI)

## Experiment

The script automatically runs two versions:

- `is_dendrite = False` ->  Standard MLP  
- `is_dendrite = True` ->  MLP with dynamic dendrite growth  

### Example Results

| Model | Test Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|-------|--------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Baseline | 61.03% | 0.6115 | 0.6053 | 0.6084 |
| + Dendrites | 63.25% | 0.6062 | 0.7558 | 0.6728 |

Dendrites improve overall F1 and recall, dynamically increasing model capacity to better capture rare fire events.

## Class Imbalance

Fire pixels represent <0.01% of total data.

Because of this:

- Balanced subsampling for training, validation, and test sets.
- BCEWithLogitsLoss with pos_weight to give more importance to positive samples.
- Recall is prioritized in evaluation metrics to ensure rare events are detected.

## How to Run

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch numpy scikit-learn perforatedai
```

### Dataset Location

Expected path:

```
fire_detection_pai_experiments/data/processed/modis_firms_train_val_test_dataset.npz
```

The file must contain:

```
X_train, y_train
X_val, y_val
X_test, y_test
```

### Launch Jupyter

From the project root directory:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then open:

```
notebooks/fire_dendrite_vs_baseline.ipynb
```

Run all cells.

## Key Observations

- Baseline MLP achieves moderate F1 and recall under balanced training.
- Dendrite restructuring increases model capacity dynamically, improving F1 and recall on test set.
- Using pos_weight in BCE loss and emphasizing recall ensures rare fire events are better captured.
- Balanced sampling stabilizes training and allows fair comparison between baseline and dendrite models.

## Future Work

- Add meteorological features (wind, humidity, drought index)
- Explore spatio-temporal models (CNN / RNN / Transformers)
- Improve precision-recall tradeoff via threshold tuning
- Evaluate full imbalanced dataset without balancing
